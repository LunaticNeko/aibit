aibit: An Idiot's Blockchain Introductory Tutorial
==================================================

This program is clearly written by someone who has spent just 6 hours reading
about blockchain and attempting to make it extremely easy.

It is a very dumbed down version from any other tutorial online, and is not
meant to be a complete version.

But most importantly, it demonstrates how simple blockchains are. If an idiot
can write it, anyone can.

Made as part of Society 5.0 Lectures A class, Kanazawa University. The class is
co-lectured with Prof. Hiroyuki OHNO and Prof. Yoshihiro MORI, and this program
was partially made due to (but not *with*) their advice.

So, if anything is wrong with it, it's going to be on me. I'm the corresponding
author here, okay?
